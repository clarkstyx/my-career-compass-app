## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Indigo (#3F51B5) to convey professionalism and focus. It's versatile and provides good contrast on a light background, avoiding clich√©s associated with job-related apps.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F0F0F5), a subtle variation of the primary hue. This ensures a clean, uncluttered interface while maintaining visual coherence.
- Accent color: A muted blue-violet (#673AB7), which is analogous to Indigo. This color differentiates call to action buttons from main UI elements.
- Clean and readable sans-serif font for form labels, and headings to maintain professionalism.
- Use consistent and simple icons to represent job application status and actions.
- Employ a card-based layout for job listings to provide a clear and organized visual structure.
